Represents the result following the NodeJS tutorial by Dave Gray, the next link is to redirect to his YouTube channel: 

âœ… [Check out my YouTube Channel with all of my tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/DaveGrayTeachesCode).

**Description:**

This repository shares the code applied during the Youtube tutorial. The tutorial is part of a [Node.js for Beginners Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6PFkIxaJ6Xx_X46avTM1aYw) on my channel.  

[YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/3ZAKY-CDKog) for this repository.

I suggest completing my [8 hour JavaScript course tutorial video](https://youtu.be/EfAl9bwzVZk) if you are new to Javascript.

### Challenge 2: Deploy this project at Glitch.

**WARNING:** I coded many times the remix button but Glitch took too long for importing my project (and didn't work), instead the walkthrough that I take is at Glitch portal > Button "New proyect" > Import from GitHub.
